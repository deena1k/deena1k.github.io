<p> Class Project: Parameters given (give time frame for this development)
    In the original prototype, I worked on picking up items, interacting with/using items,
    and the inventory display system (UI elements).

Some of the design process was based on user feedback. For example, I originally had people having to press "E"
to pick up items, but a lot of people who played our game as they felt like it was disruptive. As a result, I
went back and coded it so that people would automatically pick up items.

Another feature that I added (which wasn't showcased in the final submission due to only one item being picked up in \
 the demo) was scrolling through the inventory! People would be able to see what they had selected by pressing
x.  </p>

<p> I feel like this project was aLSO good opportunity for me because I had to realize that not everything will always
    be used in the final product. The code base was restarted from scratch for phase 3 of our project, in order
    for all of our code and documentation to be more organized. I also had to switch project teams in order 
    for us to scale up our project. For the final phase I worked on some of the assets and animations! It was
    a fun experience. Below are some of the animations and sprites I made. (if you scroll over, you can also see
    my thought process for each design!)


    (ghost rising: etheral, another chance!)
    (ghost transforming: so many objects! Wanted to make something that would minimize the
    amount of time animating. Didn't want to animate for each object, so did something that could eb
    generic. Adjusted heaight for object)
    (key in ice)
    "This week was mainly the team fixing bugs and tying the final levels together! I had a few 
    animation bugs, so I was focusing on altering those. One of the bugs were that when you transformed 
    out of the tombstone at a high level your character falls while still coming out of the tombstone, 
    and rotating rapidly. To fix this I made sure to save the gravity value before the animation occurs, 
    and then change the gravity value to 0 while the animation is in progress. This ensured that the player
     would match whatever surface they were on and not fall down. I thought this was important because this
      was happening in the first level, where players are getting used to the control. It felt important to
       standardize the reviving animation so that players could understand what's happening in the game. 
       Another bug was that the death animation would sometimes play at an angle, depending on which way 
       the player hit an object. At times it looked really weird and didn't make much logical sense, so I just 
       made sure to set the rotation to 0 when the animation began. Another kinda major bug was how the iced key 
       was sometimes delayed in its melting, which meant that it only melted when you de-possessed and then 
       re-possessed it again AFTER melting it. This was concerning, as it sometimes messed with the animators 
       order for possessing (animator would get confused which idle you were on). I made a few changes so that 
       stuff would be reset earlier (like icedKey=false), and while this works the only thing I'm worried about
        is now sometimes the animation won't play at all. This is fine if it prevents larger bugs, but it is a 
        bit disheartening because I spent 1-2 hours on it. "

        Also talk about animation when moving, speeding up animations taking too long (tiem based stuff, boring)
