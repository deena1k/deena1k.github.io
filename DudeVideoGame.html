<p> Class Project: Parameters given (give time frame for this development)
    In the original prototype, I worked on picking up items, interacting with/using items,
    and the inventory display system (UI elements).

Some of the design process was based on user feedback. For example, I originally had people having to press "E"
to pick up items, but a lot of people who played our game as they felt like it was disruptive. As a result, I
went back and coded it so that people would automatically pick up items.

Another feature that I added (which wasn't showcased in the final submission due to only one item being picked up in \
 the demo) was scrolling through the inventory! People would be able to see what they had selected by pressing
x.  </p>

<p> I feel like this project was aLSO good opportunity for me because I had to realize that not everything will always
    be used in the final product. The code base was restarted from scratch for phase 3 of our project, in order
    for all of our code and documentation to be more organized. I also had to switch project teams in order 
    for us to scale up our project. For the final phase I worked on some of the assets and animations! It was
    a fun experience. Below are some of the animations and sprites I made. (if you scroll over, you can also see
    my thought process for each design!)


    (ghost rising: etheral, another chance!)
    (ghost transforming: so many objects! Wanted to make something that would minimize the
    amount of time animating. Didn't want to animate for each object, so did something that could eb
    generic. Adjusted heaight for object)
    (key in ice)
